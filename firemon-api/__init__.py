"""
Firemon API - (firemon-api)

firemon-api is a library to assist in writing Python scripts using Firemon.

    Import the API
    >>> import fmapi
    >>> fm = fmapi.api('hobbes', 'firemon', 'firemon')
    >>> fm
    <Firemon(host='hobbes', version='8.25.9')>

    A list of all device packs installed
    >>> fm.sm.dp.all()

    A list of all devices
    >>> fm.sm.devices.all()

    Get a device
    >>> dev = fm.sm.devices.get(name='my-asa')

    Change working domain
    >>> fm.domainId = 2

    Logging for debugging. via urllib3
    >>> import logging
    >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
